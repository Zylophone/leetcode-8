Description:

Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

Note:
The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.



Example 1:
Input: 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.



Example 2:
Input: 1
Output: 0
Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.

# n : the value of input number

## Time Complexity: O( log n )
#
# The overhead in time is the cost of bit scan, which is of O( log n ).

## Space Complexity: O( 1 )
#
# The overhead in space is the storage for bit-mask, which is of O( 1 )
