'''

Description:

Given a non-negative index k where k â‰¤ 33, return the kth index row of the Pascal's triangle.

Note that the row index starts from 0.


In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.

Example:

Input: 3
Output: [1,3,3,1]
Follow up:

Could you optimize your algorithm to use only O(k) extra space?

## Time Complexity: O( n^2 )

# The overhead in time is the depth of recursion with the cost of computation, which is of O( n ) * O( n ) = O( n^2 )

# The overhead in space is the storage of recursion call stack with the storage of list comprehension, which is of O( n ) * O( n ) = O( n^2 )
