Description:

Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

Example:

Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
Output: 3 
Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. 

Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.

Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

                return idx

# n : the length of input list, citations.

## Time Complexity: O( n log n )
#
# The overhead in time is the cost of sorting, which is of O( n log n ).

## Space Complexity: O( 1 )
#
# The overhead in space is the storage for loop index and temporary variable, whichi is of O( 1 ).
