Description:

Given a n-ary tree, find its maximum depth.

The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal, each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples).


Constraints:

The depth of the n-ary tree is less than or equal to 1000.
The total number of nodes is between [0, 10^4].
