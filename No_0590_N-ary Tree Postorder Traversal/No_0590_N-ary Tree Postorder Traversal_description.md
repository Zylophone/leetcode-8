Description:

Given an n-ary tree, return the postorder traversal of its nodes' values.

Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal, each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples).

 

Follow up:

Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?

Constraints:

The height of the n-ary tree is less than or equal to 1000
The total number of nodes is between [0, 10^4]
